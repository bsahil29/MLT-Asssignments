1.	For both the codes convex.py and regress.py, place the data folder in the same directory as convex.py and regress.py 
2.	For running the convex.py file use the following terminal command :
		python3 convex.py 
3.	For running the regress.py file use the following terminal command :
		python3 regress.py
4.	Output for convex.py file is just the test-set classification accuracy which is printed on the terminal
5.	Output for regress.py file is of the following format:
		a.	first 7 lines show lambda values and corresponding test-set accuracy values separated by spaces
		b.	8th line outputs the lambda value for which test-set classification accuracy is maximum and corresponding maximum value
