1.	gen_class.py contains the python script used for binclass.txt
2.	gen_class2.py contains the python script used for binclass2.txt
3.	Place both the binclass.txt and binclass2.txt files in the same folder as these 2 scripts
4.	Commands for running these scripts :
		python3 gen_class.py	and	python3 gen_class2.py
5.	Plots that will get plotted from the 2 scripts are the learned decision boundaries and learned decision boundaries when variance for positive examples is same as variance for negative examples. The SVM part has been commented.
